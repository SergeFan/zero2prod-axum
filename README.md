# zero2prod-axum


## What is this project?

This is a personal practice project trying to replica the [Zero To Production In Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html)
but with a different web framework [Axum](https://crates.io/crates/axum) and other latest crates.
This project is host on GitLab, so it will use GitLab CI Pipeline instead of GitHub Actions.
Also, the project might be deployed using different services other than the original [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com),
which is not decided yet at this moment.
