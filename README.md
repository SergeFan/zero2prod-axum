# zero2prod-axum

## What is this project?

This is a personal practicing project trying to replicate
the [Zero To Production In Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html)
but with a different web framework [Axum](https://crates.io/crates/axum) and others.

## Main Differences

- Web framework: [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) instead
  of [Actix Web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web)
- SQL tool: [SeaORM](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm) instead of pure [sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx)
- etc.
